Task Title: Implement Version Control for Webpage Code

User Story: As a developer, I want to use a version control system to manage webpage code and collaborate with other developers.

The acceptance criteria for this task are as follows:

A version control system is selected based on the team's requirements and preferences
A repository is created to store the webpage code
The code is committed to the repository using a consistent and agreed-upon workflow
Branching and merging strategies are defined and documented
Developers are trained on how to use the version control system
Integration with other tools and workflows, such as continuous integration and deployment, is established

Effort Estimate: 10-15 Hours

Assigned To: Developer
