Task Title: Implement CI/CD tools

User Story: As a developer, I want to implement CI/CD tools to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, so that I can deliver high-quality software more quickly and reliably.

Description: This task involves implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate the software development process. The acceptance criteria for this task are:

1. Research and select a CI tool that fits the project's requirements.
2. Install and configure the CI tool on a dedicated build server or cloud-based environment.
3. Create a project in the CI tool and set up the necessary build and test scripts for the project.
4. Configure the CI tool to execute the build and test scripts automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository.
5. Test the CI tool to ensure that it works as expected.
6. Research and select a CD tool that fits the project's requirements.
7. Install and configure the CD tool on a dedicated build server or cloud-based environment.
8. Create a pipeline in the CD tool that deploys the software to staging and production environments.
9. Configure the pipeline to use the artifacts generated by the CI tool.
10. Test the CD tool to ensure that it works as expected.
11. Create a pipeline that executes the CI/CD processes automatically when a new code change is pushed to the repository.
12. Test the pipeline to ensure that it works as expected.
13. Research and select code quality tools that fit the project's requirements.
14. Integrate the code quality tools into the pipeline to ensure high-quality code.
15. Configure the pipeline to run on a dedicated build server or cloud-based environment.
16. Configure the pipeline to send notifications and alerts to developers in case of build and deployment failures.
17. Document the CI/CD process and provide guidelines for using it.

Effort Estimate: 40 hours

Assigned To: DevOps Engineer

Priority: High

Status: In Progress

Notes: The DevOps Engineer will need to work closely with the development team to ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is configured correctly for the application's specific needs. They will also need to collaborate with the IT operations team to ensure that the pipeline is integrated with existing infrastructure and processes.
